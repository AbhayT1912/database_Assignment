Q.2 Write a short note on file based storage system. Explain the major challenges of a file based storage system

Ans: A file-based storage system is a simple method of storing data in individual files. Each file contains a specific set of data, and the operating system manages these files within directories or folders. This system is commonly used for personal computers and small-scale data storage.

Major Challenges of File-Based Storage Systems

Data Redundancy: The same data may be stored in multiple files, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.
Data Isolation: Data is often siloed within individual files, making it difficult to share and integrate across different applications.
Poor Data Integrity: Lack of centralized control can lead to data corruption, inconsistencies, and errors.
Security Risks: File-based systems may have weaker security measures, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches.
Limited Scalability: As data volumes grow, file-based systems can become increasingly complex and difficult to manage.
Inefficient Data Access: Retrieving specific data can be time-consuming, especially for large datasets.
