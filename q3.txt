Q.3 What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS

Ans: A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application that interacts with a user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. It provides a structured way to store, manage, and retrieve data.   

Why Do We Need a DBMS?

Before DBMS, data was often stored in file-based systems. This approach had several limitations:   

Data Redundancy: The same data might be stored in multiple files, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.
Data Isolation: Data was often siloed within individual files, making it difficult to share and integrate across different applications.
Poor Data Integrity: Lack of centralized control could lead to data corruption, inconsistencies, and errors.   
Security Risks: File-based systems often had weaker security measures, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches.   
Limited Scalability: As data volumes grew, file-based systems became increasingly complex and difficult to manage.
Inefficient Data Access: Retrieving specific data could be time-consuming, especially for large datasets.   

DBMS addresses these issues by providing:

Data Independence: Separation of data and its applications, allowing changes to one without affecting the other.   
Data Integrity: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency through validation rules and constraints.   
Data Security: Protecting data from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.   
Data Backup and Recovery: Implementing mechanisms to safeguard data against loss or damage.   
Concurrent Access: Allowing multiple users to access and modify the same data simultaneously.   
Efficient Data Access: Optimizing data storage and retrieval for faster performance
