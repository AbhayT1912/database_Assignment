Q.7 Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages ?

Ans : Three Schema Architecture

The Three Schema Architecture is a conceptual framework that divides a database system into three levels of abstraction:

External Schema:

Defines the view of the database as seen by individual users or applications.
Each user or application has its own external schema, tailored to their specific needs.
Advantages:
Data Independence: Changes to the internal schema or conceptual schema do not affect the external schema.
Security: Different users can be granted access to specific parts of the database, protecting sensitive information.
Flexibility: Users can have personalized views of the data, tailored to their specific needs.

Conceptual Schema:

Defines the overall logical structure of the database, independent of any physical implementation.
It describes the entities, attributes, and relationships within the database.
Advantages:
Data Independence: Changes to the physical schema do not affect the conceptual schema.
Data Integrity: Ensures data consistency and accuracy by defining constraints and rules.
Data Sharing: Provides a unified view of the data, enabling multiple users to access and share information.

Internal Schema:

Defines the physical storage structure of the database, including file organizations, indexing, and storage devices.
It is the lowest level of abstraction and is concerned with how data is physically stored and accessed.
Advantages:
Performance Optimization: The physical schema can be optimized for specific query patterns and workloads.
Storage Efficiency: Data can be stored efficiently, minimizing storage costs.
Security: Physical security measures can be implemented to protect the database from unauthorized access and data loss.
